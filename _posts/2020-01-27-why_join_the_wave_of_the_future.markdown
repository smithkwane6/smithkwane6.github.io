  Seems there is an urgency to move everything to a more technical way of doing things. Making ways of life more convenient and more efficient. In order to do that more technologies needed creating and more machines built. All that is fine ,until the masses need for those technologies ,and machines to work.  That is where software development comes into the picture. From knowing how to work with a specific user to being able to work for a number of users at any given time.  Software development is, in my opinion, the heartbeat to the wave that is taking us into the future.

	

	That heartbeat is my reason for wanting to join that wave of software development. Steady pumping new blood , new information, new knowledge, and new ways of being through the body which we call the world.  From a young age I have always had a love for computers ,and what computers could do for me.  Not really thinking about how it was able to do what ever it was that I asked of it.  Later in life, once I was able to break down a computer ,and see that there were components inside that I knew nothing about. Is when I started wondering "well what does this do?".  Now with that question at the forefront of my passion for computers. I enrolled in whatever computer course I could, and found out there was way more to the story than I initially thought.  Then it dinged on me ,I guess computers need to know what to do too.  I wanted to be one of those people who told whether it be a computer, a website, or app what to do, to interact with its users.

	

	With a growing love and passion for the details of the inner workings of these amazing machines.  I decided I wanted a career in software development.  Doing what I love coding and processing for the rest of my living life.  Something I finally have no doubt about committing to. Software development  is just the base for all the amazing other things I could do with that foundation. Such as programming, analytics, and much more.  

	

	This journey is one that may be paved a little but with the ever changing ways of technologies, it will be one that is still exciting to take!
